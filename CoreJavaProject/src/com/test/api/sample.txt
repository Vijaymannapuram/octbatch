A FileInputStream obtains input bytes from a file in a file system. What files are available depends on the host environment.
FileInputStream is meant for reading streams of raw bytes such as image data. For reading streams of characters, consider using FileReader.

Since:




package com.test.api;

import java.io.FileInputStream;

public class ReadFileApp {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("");
	}

}
